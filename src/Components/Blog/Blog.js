      <h2>What is the purpose of react router?</h2>
      <p>
        React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the
        navigation among views of various components in a React Application,
        allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
      </p>
      <h2>How does context api work?</h2>
      <p>
        The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce
        global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to
        "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and
        so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state
        management using Redux
      </p>
      <h2>What is useRef used for?</h2>
      <p>
        The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be
        used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when
        updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
